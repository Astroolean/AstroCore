# AstroCore
Demonstration of a minecraft plugin I am creating. First ever Minecraft plugin. Very new to Java code. Issues and or problems are expected. This is purely for fun and or educational purposes.


# /astrocore
This is supposed to enable/disable the plugin AstroCore. When the plugin is disabled nothing will work; when enabled it will work.
# /hello
This just says hello back to the player...
# /help
This directs you to the suicide hotline...
# /god
This makes you invincible along-side the use of fly. Essentially your fucking Thanos at this point...
# /cc
This clears the fucking chat. Pretty self explanatory even for me and im retarded...
# /smoke
This is a command that consumes 16 green dye in order to get high... Custom model data support will make this more worthwhile.
# /snort
This is a command that consumes 16 sugar in order to get high... Custom model data support will make this more worthwhile.
# /gm
This is the command in order to open the Gamemode GUI alongside checks for OP status to prevent anyone from using.
# /t
This is the command in order to open the Time GUI alongside checks for OP status to prevent anyone from using.
# /w
This is the command in order to open the Weather GUI alongside checks for OP status to prevent anyone from using.
