**AstroCore** is a demonstration of a minecraft plugin I am creating. First ever Minecraft plugin. Very new to Java code. Issues and or problems are expected. This is purely for fun and or educational purposes. With the help of AI and trial and error; with the use of my knowledge of Python. Gave this a chance in order to fully learn. This is a public free and open-source minecraft plugin; available to anyone and all. I have a lot planned but little by little ill learn and continue to improve this even further along the way. This is only just the beginning... My coding journey continues here!

## Troubleshooting

- **Plugin Not Loading**: 
  - If AstroCore fails to load, check the server logs for any error messages that may indicate the issue. Common problems include:
    - Incompatible versions of the server (ensure you are using Paper 1.20.4).
    - Missing or corrupted plugin files. Make sure the `.jar` file is placed correctly in the `plugins` folder.
    - Ensure that Java is properly installed and updated to a compatible version for Minecraft.

- **Command Issues**: 
  - If commands do not seem to work:
    - Double-check that you are typing the commands correctly. Use `/ac` to see a list of available commands and their syntax.
    - Since AstroCore does not require specific permissions for commands, ensure you have the right context (e.g., being a player in the game).
    - If a command returns an unexpected response or error, consult the server logs for additional context on what might have gone wrong.

- **Gameplay Features Not Functioning**: 
  - If any features are not behaving as intended, consider:
    - Restarting your server to refresh the plugin's state.
    - Reviewing any configuration settings (if applicable) that might affect the plugin's functionality.
    - Checking for conflicts with other installed plugins that might override or interfere with AstroCore's commands.
